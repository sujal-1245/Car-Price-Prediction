## 🧠 How It Works

This app takes input about a used car and returns a predicted price using a trained regression model. It considers factors such as:

- **Brand**: Affects market value and brand reputation.
- **Year**: Newer cars tend to have higher resale value.
- **Kilometers Driven**: Higher usage typically lowers the price.
- **Fuel Type**: Petrol, Diesel, LPG — each has different performance and cost implications.

The prediction is powered by a model trained on real-world car data, offering fast and reasonably accurate price estimates.
